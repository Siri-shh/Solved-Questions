# Raw Coding Solutions

A collection of my **first-time, raw solutions** to problems from various resources (LeetCode, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks, etc.).  
The code here focuses on my **initial thought process** — it works, but may not be the most optimized or polished.

## Why this repo?

- To document my *learning journey* in coding and problem solving.  
- To track my **first attempts** before I optimize or refactor.  
- To look back and see how my thinking evolves over time.  

## Contents

The repo is organized by resource:

- `leetcode/` → First-attempt solutions from LeetCode
- `gfg/` → Solutions from GeeksforGeeks
- `codeforces/` → Contest problems from Codeforces
- `others/` → Miscellaneous problems from books, assignments, etc.


## Solution format

Each solution typically includes:
- Problem statement link (when available)
- My raw, first-time code solution
- (Optional) Notes about approach, edge cases, or things I struggled with

## Disclaimer

- These are **not optimized solutions**.  
- Expect brute-force, redundant checks, or less-than-ideal complexity.  
- The goal is correctness on first try, not performance.
